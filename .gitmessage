# How to write a commit message:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# - separate subject (first line) from body with a blank line
# - summarize your change in the subject
# - keep the subject concise, try to use no more than 80 characters
# - start the subject with a lowercase verb, end it without a period
# - use the imperative mood in the subject, i.e. write "add …" instead
#   of "added …" or "adding …"
# - the subject line should complete the following sentence:
#   "If applied, this commit will …"
